Today the new edition of GameDevJS started! The topic is _TIME_.

Easter is already past us but I have my youngest kid at home. Therefore I
can't spend the whole day with working on the jam.
But I looked into the challenges. Saldy, many are dealing with this Web3
nonsense (I consider it a big scam), but two could be worth attempting:

* [Open Source](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2023/#challenge-opensource)
* [Flash Revival](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2023/#challenge-flashrevival) 

My source code is going to be Open Source anyway.
Looking through [those Flash games](https://www.crazygames.com/t/flash) I am
thrown back to [Grow Cube](https://www.crazygames.com/game/grow-cube).

I spend the day already thinking about how to turn this into a multiplayer
experience in the hope that the topic won't interfere.

I *could* use WebGL and draw the game on Canvas element. But I want to create
accessible games that can be enjoyed by different people. Therefore I will
again turn to my old friends HTML + CSS + JS + SVG.
The architecture is going to be state driven. I'm a bit nervous about
transitions (especially when managing the active element), but have an
understanding already how to handle the basic concepts.

Using the state as my main source of truth will allow me to use
different input sources (mouse, keyboard, touch, game controller,
device sensors, you name it) and offer different outputs (from traditional
visuals over table based to A-Frame/VR).

The state will be managed with an architecture that resembles Redux, but
without all the fluff.

## Today's achievement

I created a new git repo on my Forgejo instance (to be pushed to
GitHub towards the end of the jam period) and scaffolded the directory
structure.

I have a first build running locally. The setup for Husky required a
[little ceremony](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=yarn-2).

## Next steps

I will need to have a Node.js service somewhere. Heroku is out of question now

I will need to have a Node.js service somewhere. Heroku is out of question
now. I will have to run an Express.js server (or alternative) that exposes
socket.io to broker messages between different player devices.

I also should create a dev blog on itch.io to mirror my journal here.

Finally I thought about using PeerTube to record some of my thoughts during
development.

### Codewise

Implement transitions between scenes. This will require defining action
creators and reducers as well as setting up my first event listener and
weaving it into the state.

If I still find time, I should look into not resetting the DOM every time
but instead mutate it. I had an entry where I did that in the past.

### Next in line

See journal entry from [tomorrow](./2023-04-14.md).

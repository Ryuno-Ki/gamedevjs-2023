I took the day to refactor some code to be better able to test the game.

## Today's achievement

I was able to wrestle the win condition into an unit test. I feel like there
might be some loopholes but I need to get the project ready for submission now.

Especially frustrating to not be able to playtest it extensively again :(

## Next steps

Unit test gameover condition and add logic to create new rounds.

### Codewise

Slight progression.

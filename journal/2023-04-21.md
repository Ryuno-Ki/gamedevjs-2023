I managed to have a basic run from title to gameover.
Now I spent a day on refactoring before moving on with refining the game.
I also filled the About scene before I forget it.

## Today's achievement

Refactored some parts that bugged me since quite some time.

## Next steps

Deploy the game to GitHub and Codeberg pages.

### Codewise

Refine the UI.

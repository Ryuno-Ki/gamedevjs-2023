Another day of refactoring and a little development.

## Today's achievement

I have unit tested the gameover checks (now a reducer).
Now I also progress in rounds and turns!
I also added a setting for switching the theme. If I find the time I can add
volume control here as well. Most likely picking CC Mixter track given the
remaining time.

## Next steps

Break apart the level scene to make it easier to improve.

### Codewise

Deploy!

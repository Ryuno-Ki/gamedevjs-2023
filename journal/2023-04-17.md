So I want to get to a playable prototype fast. I finished up the minimal
new game scene and started with designing the first level, so I get a sense of
layout challenges. I also studied about isometric drawing:

* https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zffhsrd/revision/2
* https://architecturerevived.com/how-to-draw-a-perfect-cube-in-perspective/
* https://www.creativebloq.com/features/isometric-drawing
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection

and picked a first world to get the basics down.

What's left then is to add the cards and game mechanics.

## Today's achievement

Including OpenMoji was a bit of a challenge, because it is designed for Node.js
and only limited useful in ESM context. I ended up with reading the JSON and
filtering the emojis I need before writing it into a vendored JS file.
There is some work needed to turn the provided TTF into WOFF2 format, so I can
ship an emoji font as well as extending the About scene with the license
information to stay compliant. I will defer this to a time when I know which
emojis I need for this prototype to avoid repeated work.

## Next steps

Before I start recording video I want to have the basic game mechanics down.
Yes, my architectural choices slows me down a bit but this is on purpose.
I want to have high quality results. Speaking of which I noticed some flaky
tests which is no good.

Listening to this Changelog episode makes me want to include JSON schemas to
improve the test quality of my reducers by throwing a wider range of inputs
at them:

### Codewise

I will finish the world UI next and refactor the layout. Looks like I can't use
HTML next to SVG here without jumping over hurdles. Might as well go SVG only.
I should also check the experience with a screenreader soon.

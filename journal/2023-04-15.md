Today I catched up with the results I've meant to reach yesterday.

## Today's achievement

I extended the initial state with a XState definition of transitioning between
scenes. In case you haven't heard of it, XState is a library that aids with
defining Finite State Machines in JavaScript.
I'm following the project since a while and finally took the step to implement
it in one of my projects. At least partially. I haven't decided whether I want
to adopt the whole library.
But at least I can now use the definitions in the editor.

I also figured out how to add a banner to JavaScript bundles.

## Next steps

I will develop a paper prototype tomorrow and play around with ideas together
with my family. A fun weekend project.

I won't achieve much tomorrow but can spend more time over the next week.

### Codewise

I want to add a minimum level of styling to the links.
I can also add links back to the repository in the About scene.

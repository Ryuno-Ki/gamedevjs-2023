I was blocked for the majority of my day by freezing computer.
Turned out I accidentally created an infinite loop that not only
consumed all my CPU but by the loop body RAM also. I was able to
pinpoint the cause with help on Mastodon. Shout out to the Fediverse
here!

## Today's achievement

I started a refactoring of the faces logic for the cube after moving
the players into SVG land, so I have total control over the layout.
Otherwise the HTML pushed down the SVG. I could have positioned them
absolute but that would remove the player elements from the DOM and
therefore become inaccessible.

## Next steps

I gotta go fast now if I want to have a working game in the first week.
Otherwise I won't be able to optimise the gameplay.

### Codewise

I need to have the win/gameover scene and cards, so I can develop the
round state machine.

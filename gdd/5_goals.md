to remember successful orders of cards.

## Game Mechanics

Each world is defined by a cube and a stack of ten cards.
Each player is dealt five cards in random order from this stack.
There are three players (possible controlled by a bot to stand in for humans).
The majority of a card type is applied.
If there is a draw, a random choice is made.

There are three categories of cards.

Each cube has five combinations of orders that will lead to a win condition.

Worlds are defined by ten emojis and those five combinations consisting of
these emojis (not all have to be picked).

Each turn is recorded and can be replayed. It is possible to create a new
party after any of those rounds to experiment with different outcomes.

## Items and power-ups

A deck of ten cards (displaying the ten emojis each) is shuffled.
Each player is dealt five cards. The deck is not shared among players.

## Progression and challenge

The first playthrough of all worlds will unlock a world builder.
Subsequent plays allow for more emojis to pick from building worlds.

World configs can be shared and pasted into a textarea.

## Loosing condition

If no card is left but no win condition was met.

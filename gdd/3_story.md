# Story

All players start with the same cube.
They get dealt a set of five cards from a stack and can pick one.
Depending on which card type gets the most votes different effects apply.

The background story could revolve around different parties arguing about how
to develop a world. Since they can't come to an agreement with arguments alone
the decision is left to a game.

## Theme

I want to have a calm, lighthearted game.

# Art style

The game will have different representations.
An isometric perspective with three planes of a cube is shown
(top, left and right).
Another representation consists of tables and buttons to make choices.

Each plane consists of ten by ten squares. A colour palette of four colours
is applied to each tile. The colours are saturated.
The background is a light blue to provide contrast.

Applying cards will alter the cube.

Avatars will follow a comic style in the art style of Pepper & Carrot.

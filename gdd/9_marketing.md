# Marketing

The game will be uploaded to itch (because it is part of a game jam).
Hashtag will be the one provided by the jam as well as one that consists of
the game title.

Every day I am writing a journal that will be shared as a dev log on itch as well.

I will develop a paper prototype to test with my family.

## Demographics

The game requires at the very minimum some memory skills.
Therefore players should be at least at elementary school level.
Reading skills are beneficial.

The game is intended for casual play.

## Platforms

The web.

## Localization

I will only provide English for now. I haven't figured out a good way to
implement internationalisation.
